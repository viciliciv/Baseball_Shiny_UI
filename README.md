# Baseball Comparison Projection Project

This is a shiny app created to project Baseball players HR, RBIs, and SLG.

It utilizes Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm (PECOTA), developed by Nate Silver, to predict a players projection based on similarities to historical players.

The application was created to compare Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion after the 2016 MLB season and determine which player will have a better projection.
